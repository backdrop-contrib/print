# Printer, email and PDF versions

This module allows you to generate the following printer-friendly versions
of any node (where `nid` is the node id of content to render):

    * Web page printer-friendly version (at www.example.com/print/nid)
    * PDF version (at www.example.com/printpdf/nid)
    * EPUB version (at www.example.com/printepub/nid)
    * Send by-email (at www.example.com/printmail/nid)

A link is inserted in the each node (configurable in the content type
settings), that opens a version of the page with no sidebars, search boxes,
navigation pages, etc.
