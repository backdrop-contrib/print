Name: Print module
Maintainer: Joao Ventura <joao at venturas dot org>
Author: Matt Westgate <drupal at asitis dot org>
********************************************************************
INSTALLATION:

1. Decompress the print-n.x-n.n.tar.gz file into your Drupal modules directory (usually sites/all/modules, see http://drupal.org/node/176044 for more information).

2. Enable the print module:
    Administer > Site building > Modules (admin/build/modules)

3. Configure access rules:
    Administer > User management > Access control (admin/user/access)

4. Configure:
    Administer > Site configuration > Printer-friendly (admin/settings/print)

********************************************************************
PRINT_PDF module:

The print_pdf module requires the use of an external PDF generation tool.
The currently supported tools are dompdf and TCPDF.

dompdf support:
  The dompdf tool produces results that are more faithful to the HTML printer-friendly page.

  1. Download dompdf from http://sourceforge.net/projects/dompdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into the print module directory (usually sites/all/modules/print)
  3. Edit dompdf_config.inc.php to fit your installation.
  4. Grant write access to the lib/fonts directory to your webserver user.
  5. If you're using dompdf-0.5.1, delete the dompdf.php file as it contains a security vulnerability
  6. Check http://www.digitaljunkies.ca/dompdf/ for further information.

TCPDF support:
  TCPDF seems to be more actively developed than dompdf, but it's support for CSS is considerably worse.

  1. Download TCPDF from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into the print module directory (usually sites/all/modules/print)
  3. Edit the config/tcpdf_config.php file to fit your installation.
  4. Check http://tcpdf.sourceforge.net/ for further information.

********************************************************************
UPDATE:

When updating from a previous version, just remove the print directory and follow the instructions above. Make sure that you backup any costumization to the print.tpl.php and print.css files.

********************************************************************
ROBOTS:

Even though it is possible to set per-page robots settings, the following can be placed in your robots.txt file after the User-agent line to prevent search engines from even asking for the page:

Disallow: /print/

Also, for updates from older versions (<=4.7.x-1.0 and <=5.x-1.2) which used node/nnn/print instead of print/nnn, the following lines can prevent requests from Google for the obsolete print URLs:

Disallow: /*/print$

Note that pattern matching in robots.txt is a Google extension (see http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40367 for more information).

********************************************************************
CUSTOMIZATION:

- To modify the template of printer friendly pages, simply edit the print.tpl.php or the print.css files found in this directory.

- It is possible to set per-content-type and/or theme-specific templates which are searched for in the following order:
  i. print.node-$type.tpl.php in the theme directory
 ii. print.node-$type.tpl.php in the module directory
iii. print.tpl.php in the theme directory
 iv. print.tpl.php in the module directory (supplied by the module)
